cakepphlogger
=============

Random thoughts on a replacement for pphlogger

BTW, you will need cakephp 2.4 to make this work if you clone this. I don't know how often this will be updated, but I'm trying my best to keep the framework out of this ... at least for now. Reason? I'm going to be testing against multiple versions of CakePHP (ideally, shouldn't need much changes from 2.3+) and so you can choose which one to use.

Why CakePHP?

Because I know something about how it works, and it's a language you probably know or have set up.

Also, because this is a framework, *any* changes you need to make for database connection, php version, logging, etc., should be abstractly unrelated to the frontend. 

If this works properly, and I'm not skimping too much, this will end up being a true MVC app. That means that you should be able to skin this easily for your needs, plug in authentication according to your needs, with little worries of if this will work with your configuration.

Yes, at least that's the goal. 

Let's see where we go from here?
